                <p>Some cats will nap in dirty cardboard boxes, on dank water heaters, or on the dusty slats
                under your bed. However, if you're buying your cat a bed, it should be comfortable, secure, 
                and great for kneading</p>

            <h1>About the Vet</h1>
                <p>It  is necessary to be registered with a local vet before you adopt a cat and currently be under their care for any possible medical issues.
                How much might my veterinary costs be, roughly? You will have a good grasp of what things cost and whether or not you can realistically give a cat all it needs for its lifetime. It’s always good to inquire with your vet how much things might cost like blood tests and scans for example.
                Where is my cat's vaccination card and microchip number? It is always useful to have this info to hand when you need it for vet visits. The cat's microchip details can usually be found on your cat's vaccination card.
